# Steps

## Register Data API in AD

1.  Log into the Azure portal using your Azure credentials

2.  Make sure you are in the correct AD tenant environment (e.g.
    contoso.onmicrosoft.com)

3.  Navigate to Azure Active Directory resource on the nav toolbar

4.  Under 'App Registrations', click 'New application registration' and
    complete as follows:

    a. **Name**: Data API (or any other name of your choice)

    b. **Application Type**: Web app/API

    c. **Sign-on URL**:
    [https://customwebapi.azurewebsites.net](https://customwebapi.azurewebsites.net)
    (it can be any valid URI)

5.  Click 'Create' button.

6.  Upon creation copy the Display name, Application ID and the Home
    page values into the table above.

7.  Click 'Settings'

8.  Click on 'Properties'

9.  Change the value of the App ID URI to the unique URI that Data API
    will use as the audience identifier when presenting itself to the
    client apps. It can be changed later.
    [https://contoso.onmicrosoft.com/webapi](https://contoso.onmicrosoft.com/datapi)

10. Click 'Save'

11. Go onto the previous blade and click 'Manifest' pen icon on the menu
    bar. It will open a new blade with the 'Edit manifest' title. The
    manifest JSON configuration settings will be displayed.

12. Find the line 21 containing the value for 'oauth2AllowImplicitFlow'.
    Change its value from 'false' to 'true' (without quotations).

13. Find in the 3^rd^ line the entry for 'appRoles'. It will have the
    empty '\[\]' brackets. Replace the entire line with the following
    lines:

> \"appRoles\": \[
>
> {
>
> \"allowedMemberTypes\": \[
>
> \"Application\"
>
> \],
>
> \"description\": \"Allows applications to access this api\",
>
> \"displayName\": \"Access this api as an importer process\",
>
> \"id\": \"6222887c-2a18-4b96-9a8d-548f88faf77c\",
>
> \"isEnabled\": true,
>
> \"value\": \"ImporterProcess\"
>
> }
>
> \],

14. Click 'Save'. If you received an error, make sure you've copied the
    lines in the Step 12 all correctly and the manifest is in a properly
    formed JSON format. Then, try again to save it.

## Register Client APP in AD

1.  Under 'App Registrations', click 'New application registration' and
    complete as follows:

    a. **Name**: Data API Client App (or any other name of your choice)

    b. **Application Type**: Web app/API

    c. **Sign-on URL**:
    [https://customclientapp](https://jberclientapp) (it can be any
    valid URI)

2.  Click 'Create' button.

3.  Upon creation copy the Display name, Application ID and the Home
    page values into the table above.

4.  Click 'Manifest' pen icon on the menu bar. It will open a new blade
    with the 'Edit manifest' title. The manifest JSON configuration
    settings will be displayed.

5.  Find the line 21 containing the value for 'oauth2AllowImplicitFlow'.
    Change its value from 'false' to 'true' (without quotations).

6.  Click 'Save'

7.  Go back to the previous blade and click 'Settings'

8.  Click on 'Required Permissions'

9.  Click '+Add'

10. Click 'Select an API'

11. In the 'Search for other applications with Service Principal name'
    input box enter the first letters of the API registration you've
    created in the previous section, e.g. 'Data API'

12. Find the API registration you created earlier and select it from the
    list.

13. Click 'Select' button.

14. Select both check boxes on: one is for Application Permissions and
    the other is for Delegated Permissions.

15. Click 'Select' button.

16. Click 'Done' button after confirming that you have two steps with 1
    role and 1 scope selected for the API permissions.

17. Click '+Add' again to add permissions for accessing Azure KeyVault

18. Click 'Select an API'

19. In the 'Search for other applications with Service Principal name'
    input box enter 'Azure Key Vault'

20. Click 'Select' button.

21. Select the check box for the Delegated Permissions.

22. Click 'Select' button.

23. Click 'Done' button.

24. Click on 'Keys' from API Access section under 'Settings'

25. Enter the Key description (e.g. 'AccessDataAPI')

26. Select the desired expiration period: either in 1, 2 years or never
    expires.

27. Click 'Save'

28. Do not close the screen until you copy the value of the newly
    generated secret. Paste the secret value into your table.

29. At this point you have all app registrations configured and are
    ready to go the next step.

## Obtain the User Consent from Azure AD

1.  Open a Internet browser of your choice in the in-private mode.
    Chrome is recommended.

2.  Enter the URL into the browser's address line that is constructed in
    the following format:

[**https://login.microsoftonline.com/\<tenant\>.onmicrosoft.com/oauth2/authorize**](https://login.microsoftonline.com/%3ctenant%3e.onmicrosoft.com/oauth2/authorize)

**?client_id=\<Application ID\>&resource=\<App Id
URI\>&redirect_uri=\<Sign-on
URL\>&response_type=code&prompt=admin_consent**

> replacing the template values with the settings you've collected in
> the previous steps.

3.  Enter your URL into the browser's address line and run it.

4.  You will be redirected to your organization's login screen where you
    would need to provide your login credentials of the user with the
    Global Admin permissions to your Azure AD.
    ![doc/assets/doc01pic02.png](doc/assets/doc01pic02.png)

5.  Once logged in, you will be prompted to consent on giving the
    permissions to your Azure Data API Client App to access the Azure
    Data API. **Note:** It will also show the 'Sign in and read user
    profile', but you can safely ignore this was never requested and
    won't be executed on your behalf. It is rather a UI misconception
    than the real permission request.
    ![doc/assets/doc01pic03.png](doc/assets/doc01pic03.png)

6.  Click 'Accept' button.

7.  After a while, you will be redirected to non-existent page with the
    address line showing something similar to this line:

    [https://customclientapp/?code=AQABAAIAAAC5una0EUFg\...]{.underline}

8.  You're done!

## Configuring Role Base Access Control (RBAC)

This package provides the framework for extended functionality when RBAC is required. To show how it works, the following scenario is fully implemented in the provided NPM package:
The user can be authorized to access the back-end API resource only if she is a member of the specified Azure AD Security Group. The full example of this scenario is provided in the [authorization](./examples/authorization) sample node project that you can clone from the GitHub. The example requires that an user is a member of the specified AD Group, the name of which is also stored in the .env file (Environment variables).
Additionally, the required permission must be added to the API Client APP settings. To enable these permissions, execute the following steps:

1.  Log into the Azure portal using your Azure credentials

2.  Make sure you are in the correct AD tenant environment (e.g.
    contoso.onmicrosoft.com)

3.  Navigate to Azure Active Directory resource on the nav toolbar

4.  Under 'App Registrations (Preview)', find the client APP registration and double click it to open its properties blade.
5.  Find the 'API permissions' menu under the Manage navigation toolbar.
6.  Then click '+ Add a permissions' to open the 'Request API permissions' page.
7.  Find the Microsoft Graph API (most likely to be the very first of most commonly used Microsoft APIs) and select it.
8.  Under 'What type of permissions does your application require?' select 'Application permissions'. Note: we're going to allow the client APP to get the user's AD data on the user's behalf once user is authenticated.
9.  Under 'Select permissions' list, select the following required permissions for this scenario:
    1.  Directory: Directory.Read.All
    2.  Group: Group.Read.All
    3.  User: User.Read.All
10. Then click 'Add Permissions' button to save your selection
11. You might be asked to grant consent after adding new API permissions even if you have already granted consent previously.
12. Then, follow the description for how to run [authorization](./examples/authorization) sample project to test this RBAC scenario.

## Test Registration in PostMan

1.  Launch the PostMan desktop application

2.  You don't have to sign up or sign in to test this registration.

3.  Once in the Builder workspace, enter the following URL into the
    address line:

> [https://login.microsoftonline.com/\<tenant\>.onmicrosoft.com/oauth2/token]{.underline}

4.  Make sure you're constructing the POST URL call.

5.  Click on the 'Headers' tab.

6.  Enter the 'Content-Type' for the Header's key.

7.  Enter the 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' for the Header's
    value.

8.  Click on 'Body' tab.

9.  Enter the following values into the body's key/value settings:

| Key           | Value                                        |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| client_id     | 7481b2a1-7dfc-477a-a21b-e1c854114863         |
| client_secret | MyMWOGH8l4tUeR9NTPCilamf3/k9SZxIk5/B+dPQWUM= |
| resource      | https://contoso.onmicrosoft.com/webapi       |
| grant_type    | client_credentials                           |

10. Click 'Send' button.

11. Upon successful authentication you should receive in the Body of the
    response message the JWT token 'access_token' among the other
    properties. It will be similar to this screenshot:
    ![doc/assets/doc01pic04.png](doc/assets/doc01pic04.png)

12. This access token will then be used to authenticate the client
    application against Azure Azure Active Directory and get permissions
    to access the Data API. In order to verify that this token indeed is
    the one would grant you access to the Data API, you can optionally
    copy the content of your access_token content and then decode it
    using the following JWT decoding online service: <http://jwt.ms/>

13. Copy the entire content of the access_token from PostMan.

14. Launch your Internet browser and navigate to: <http://jwt.ms/>

15. Paste the token's content into the first top window.

16. If the token is valid, it will be decoded in the bottom window where
    you could check all its values, including the 'roles' values that
    should state: "ImporterProcess". That means this token allows access
    only and only to the process with ImporterProcess, which, in our
    case, is our Data API service.

Congratulations! You've completed all steps required to register Data
API and the client application in your Azure Active Directory.
